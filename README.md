Certainly! Here are some suggestions to make your description cleaner and more concise:

I developed a web application for my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) college course, utilizing React.js for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. The app includes the following features:

1) User Authentication:
 Sign up and log in functionalities.

2) Product Management:
View detailed information about products.

3) Shopping Cart:
Logged-in users can add products to their cart.

4) Checkout Process:
Users can proceed to checkout and input card details (simulating a purchase without actual transactions).

5) Product Discovery:
Search and filter options available for users/guests.

6) Sorting Functionality:
Sort products by price for each product type.

7) Responsive Web Design (RWD):
